You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. XeLaTeX This is a sample book written in Markdown.

["about-the-author.html", "About the Author", " About the Author Yihui Xie (http://yihui.org) is a software engineer at RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com). He earned his PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. He is interested in interactive statistical graphics and statistical computing. As an active R user, he has authored several R packages, such as knitr, bookdown, blogdown, animation, DT, tinytex, tufte, formatR, fun, mime, highr, servr, and Rd2roxygen, among which the animation package won the 2009 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award (ASA). He also co-authored a few other R packages, including shiny, rmarkdown, and leaflet. In 2006, he founded the Capital of Statistics (https://cosx.org), which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. He initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and has been involved in organizing R conferences in China since then. During his PhD training at Iowa State University, he won the Vince Sposito Statistical Computing Award (2011) and the Snedecor Award (2012) in the Department of Statistics. He occasionally rants on Twitter (https://twitter.com/xieyihui), and most of the time you can find him on GitHub (https://github.com/yihui). He enjoys spicy food as much as classical Chinese literature. "],
["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 2. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figura 0.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 0.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 0.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Tabla 0.1: Here is a nice table!

The approach is based on Pandoc, so we start with the syntax of Pandoc’s flavor of Markdown. C.1 Markdown syntax In this section, we give a very brief introduction to Pandoc’s Markdown. Readers who are familiar with Markdown can skip this section. The comprehensive syntax of Pandoc’s Markdown can be found on the Pandoc website http://pandoc.org. "],
